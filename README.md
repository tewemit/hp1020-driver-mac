# HP LaserJet 1020 — Modern macOS Driver

HP never released an official driver for the LaserJet 1020 Printer for modern macOS versions (13 and above) eg. Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia, or Tahoe.

This repo is an ultra minimal, stripped-down, patched and community-maintained driver package that gets the HP LaserJet 1020 Printer fully working on modern macOS in under 4MB.

It works by extracting only the 4 files that actually matter from Apple's HP Printer Drivers 5.1.1 package, placing them in the right locations, and using the most-compatible LaserJet 1022 PPD (which drives the 1020 Printer hardware perfectly).

Tested and working on: **macOS 26 Tahoe**.

## Why does this exist?

The HP LaserJet printers uses a proprietary print language called ZJS. Apple's HP driver package contains a CUPS filter (`rasterToHPZJS`) that handles the conversion — but the installer is hard-blocked to only run on macOS 12.0 or older. The printer hardware itself works fine, the drivers work fine, Apple just never updated the version check.

This repo skips all of that and gives you just the files you need to get it on 1020 family printers working.

## Install

### 1. Clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anxkhn/hp1020-driver-mac
cd hp1020-driver-mac
```

### 2. Place the files

```bash
# PPD
sudo cp "HP LaserJet 1022.gz" "/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/"

# Create the bundle structure
sudo mkdir -p "/Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/hplaserjetzjs.bundle/Contents/MacOS"
sudo mkdir -p "/Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/hplaserjetzjs.bundle/Contents/Resources"

# Filters
sudo cp rasterToHPZJS "/Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/hplaserjetzjs.bundle/Contents/MacOS/"
sudo cp commandToHPZJS "/Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/hplaserjetzjs.bundle/Contents/MacOS/"

# Firmware
sudo cp hp1020.acl "/Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/hplaserjetzjs.bundle/Contents/Resources/"

# Fix permissions
sudo chmod 755 "/Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/hplaserjetzjs.bundle/Contents/MacOS/rasterToHPZJS"
sudo chmod 755 "/Library/Printers/hp/laserjet/hplaserjetzjs.bundle/Contents/MacOS/commandToHPZJS"
```

### 3. Connect the printer

- Plug in the HP LaserJet 1020 via USB (USB-B cable; use a USB-C adapter)
- Power it on
- Confirm macOS sees it:

```bash
lpinfo -v | grep -i usb
# expected output: direct usb://Hewlett-Packard/HP%20LaserJet%201020?serial=...
```

### 4. Add the printer

Copy the full URI from the output above and run:

```bash
lpadmin -p "HP_LaserJet_1020" -E \
  -v "usb://Hewlett-Packard/HP%20LaserJet%201020?serial=YOURSERIAL" \
  -P "/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/HP LaserJet 1022.gz" \
  -D "HP LaserJet 1020"
```

---

## Print

```bash
# print a file
lp -d HP_LaserJet_1020 /path/to/file.pdf

# print many files with specific extension
lp -d HP_LaserJet_1020 *.pdf

# print a specific page
lp -d HP_LaserJet_1020 -o page-ranges=2 /path/to/file.pdf

# check print queue
lpstat -p HP_LaserJet_1020
```

---

## Notes

- Sometimes the usb port id may change or get dropped and jobs stop printing. In this case, re-list the usb ports and run below command with the new usb addres
```bash
lpadmin -p "HP_LaserJet_1020" -E \
  -v "usb://Hewlett-Packard/HP%20LaserJet%201020?serial=YOURSERIAL" \
  -P "/Library/Printers/PPDs/Contents/Resources/HP LaserJet 1022.gz" \
  -D "HP LaserJet 1020"
```  
- The `lpadmin: Printer drivers are deprecated` warning from CUPS is harmless — printing works fine
- Uses the **LaserJet 1022** PPD, which is tested to be compatible with the 1020 hardware
- The binaries are universal (x86_64 + arm64) — works on both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs
